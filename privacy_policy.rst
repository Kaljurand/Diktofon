==============

Diktofon uses a third-party speech recognition server (http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/webtrans) to transcribe audio files. An audio file is uploaded for transcription only if the user chooses the "Transcribe" menu option. While uploading an audio file and downloading the resulting transcription, the network connection is not encrypted.

Apart from using a third-party speech recognition server as described above, Diktofon does not collect nor share any user data. The source code of all Diktofon components and their dependencies is open and available at https://github.com/Kaljurand/Diktofon.
